**Hi, Iâ€™m Quentin ðŸ‘‹**

Iâ€™m a creative technologist exploring how we can build more intentional, expressive, and human-centered tools.

I work mostly in Figma Make, Spline, and visual development environments â€” prototyping interfaces that help people think, feel, and make better decisions.

**Current Projects ðŸ› **
- A social journaling app to connect scattered thoughts and reflect with clarity  
- Real-time visual experiments using p5.js, motion sensors, and live data  
- Tools for note-taking, meaning-making, and personal systems thinking

Most of my work isn't hosted on GitHub â€” you can find it all on [my website](https://qrenaud.com).
