# Hi, Iâ€™m Quentin ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **human-centered data strategist** working at the intersection of **AI, data, and machine learning** â€” turning complex, messy information into **actionable, impactful tools**.

My focus: **large language model (LLM) development** and **tangible, operational applications** that help organizations make better decisions.

## ðŸ›  Current Projects
- **Fraud Detection in Palantir Foundry** â€” Leveraging Benfordâ€™s Law to detect anomalies in financial statements, predicting accounting irregularities before they escalate.
- **Portfolio Risk Modeling** â€” Assessing fraud likelihood based on repeated deviations from expected probability distributions.
- **LLM-Powered Decision Support** â€” Building interfaces that bridge human insight with machine intelligence.

## ðŸŽ¨ Experimental & Creative Work
Alongside my AI work, I explore projects that expand the way we think and create:
- **Sensemaking App** â€” Tools for knowledge organization and insight discovery.
- **Social Journaling Platform** â€” Designing interfaces for shared reflection and community storytelling.
- **Mathematical Digital Art** â€” Generating visuals in TouchDesigner using mathematical functions.
