**Intent**

How to make Apple Notes 10x better. During user research, I discovered that people are not trying to take better notes, but make more sense, of themselves and of their world they live in. Intent is an attempt at designing a notetaking app to meet these needs by designing never-seen-before features: pyramid of sense, conflict detection, on top of a range of auto-organisation to make your notes easy to find.

**Reflect**

Building a journaling practice is hard yet so rewarding. And when we could spend some quality time journaling, we choose instead to play wordle, or scroll on socials. Reflect stems from the idea that journaling could be fun if it was a shared practice with a trusted circle. I started simple. Everyday, all users answer the same new question like "What's one thing you like about yourself that rarely gets noticed", you can follow your friends or family and see how they answered, or post anonymously and explored other people's answer. It can be a meaningful way to keep nurturing deep relationships with your loved ones, or feel less alone as you explore other people's answer.

**Luma Scraper**

Going to events always feel like a gamble. You can meet a person who will change your life (and that's why it's so worth it) or it can be a complete waste of time. I felt that deeply as a VC, and honestly it was 50/50. What if we could skew the odds? I built an app where you can paste the URL of the event you're going to, write a description of the type of folks you'd like to meet, that returns folks who match your description and why, as well as their social links, to make sure you can actually meet at the event.
